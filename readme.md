# chastity bot
This bot, coded by [Skylar](https://twitter.com/skylarthefemboy), can save a key safe code in a MySQL database and edit the value on the fly with Discord slash commands.
I have designed this with long distance relationships in mind to ensure the sub may still access their keys if necessary. 

## How does it work??
The way me and my owner use it is shown below
- Lock the cage on a video call
- Close my eyes while I set the code on my key safe
- Show the code to my owner, still not looking at the code myself
- Owner uses this bot to upload the code to the database
- I can use /unlock in an emergency if I need to

## Commands
- /lock - Command used by the owner/master to change the unlock code value in the database
- /unlock - Command used by the sub in order to see their code in an emergency
These are the only commands supported at the moment as this is designed to be a very simple bot to be used privately between dom and sub

## Server template
Using [this server template](https://discord.new/5mFStW2cjsQu) you will have both roles automatically created for you in order to use the bot properly.
To copy the role ID, ensure that you have developer mode on, right click on the role on someones profile or in the role menu and click copy ID
The ID needed for the config file will be copied to your clipboard
